help: If you want your codec list to take precedence
syntax:expression: $VAR(@) in "generous", "greedy", "scrooge"
update:sudo /opt/vyatta/sbin/vyatta-freeswitch.pl --profile=$VAR(../../@) --action=update
comp_help: Possible completions:
  generous      permits the remote codec list have precedence and the codec negotiation and selection process
  greedy        forces a win by the local FreeSWITCH preference list
  scrooge       takes greedy a step further, so that the FreeSWITCH wins even when the far side lies about capabilities during the negotiation process
